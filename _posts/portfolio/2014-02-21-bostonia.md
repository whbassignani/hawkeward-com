### Project Summary

[*Bostonia*](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia) is BU’s award-winning, print and online alumni magazine. We build everything responsively, including the feature stories, and publish three times a year.

### Role

First and foremost, *Bostonia* is a team effort: it truly takes a village.

My primary purpose is to maintain and improve the site’s front-end and CMS. I designed and built the current homepage design and internal page templates. The online magazine constantly evolves, however, so stay tuned.

I also build feature stories and interactive content for *Bostonia*. BU ID’s web designers translate the print magazine to the web, and the developers (myself included) make them real.

### Highlights

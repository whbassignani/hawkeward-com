### Project Summary

[*Bostonia*](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia) is BU’s award-winning, print and online alumni magazine. We build everything responsively, including the feature stories, and publish three times a year.

### Role

First and foremost, *Bostonia* is a team effort: it truly takes a village.

My primary purpose is to maintain and improve the site’s front-end and CMS. I designed and built the current homepage design and internal page templates. The online magazine constantly evolves, however, so stay tuned.

I also build feature stories and interactive content for *Bostonia*. BU ID’s web designers translate the print magazine to the web, and the developers (myself included) make them real.

### Highlights

1.	The current [homepage](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring14) and theme design.
2.	Our three-part feature on [China](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring14/china) (Spring 2014), available in both English and [Chinese](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring14/china/chinese/).
3.	Some of the features that I had the privilege to build: [Wine](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/fall13/wine), [High Notes](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/high-notes), [Rowing to Kabul](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer13/rowing), [Warming](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer13/warming), [Damages](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring13/station-nightclub), [More on Moore](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer12/moore), and [Secret Lives](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer12/secret). I also designed nine stories in the [Campaign 2012](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/campaign12) issue, including [Boston Scholars](http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/campaign12/boston-scholars).

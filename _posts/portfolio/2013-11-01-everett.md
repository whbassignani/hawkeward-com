### Project Summary

[Everett](http://www.bu.edu/everett) is the BU School of Management’s online alumni magazine. The print magazine’s format used many short stories instead of traditional longform. This project’s designer wanted to reflect that on the web.

### Role

Built the site’s front-end, as well as back-end custom functionality to fine-tune the content “mosaic.”

### Highlights

1.	A powerful CMS back-end to give designers easy control over complex layouts and typography.
2.	The filterable and flexible homepage with quotes, images, stories, and infographics.

### Project Summary

[FitRec](http://www.bu.edu/fitrec) is BU’s fitness center. BU Interactive Design redesigned their website and customized the WordPress-powered back-end to be highly editor-friendly.

### Role

My primary responsibility was the build. This involved both standard front-end development as well as customizing the WP-Admin with settings pages and meta boxes to streamline editing and prevent editor mistakes. <span class="em-role">Build</span>

I also contributed design to many of the responsive layouts in the process of building the site, adjusting any desktop-only mockups to fit multiple viewports. <span class="em-role">Design, build</span>

FitRec was built using Sass and mobile-first web development.

### Highlights

1.	A mobile-first, preprocessor-enabled front-end build that implements my teammate’s modern design.
2.	The robust back-end customizations that prevent site editors from inadvertantly breaking the site or omitting content.

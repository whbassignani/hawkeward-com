<p class="lede">The two former pizza places around the corner from my apartment have been closed for almost two years.</p>

One is now a fancy Chinese restaurant, and the other is an empty shell with dusty, built-in booth seating. I’ve lived in the area long enough to remember a time when both would bustle all-day (even into the early mornings of my undergraduate days). In fact, both went through two renovations each in the seven years that we’ve been neighbors, and I remember each one.

Boston University students often talk about getting stuck in the “BUbble.” Most students lives on campus. There are more than enough dining halls, restaurants, and shopping/entertainment venues within a few hundred yards of any dorm. In other words, you never have to leave if you don’t want to.

The problem is that when your father attends a school (twice), and then you do the same… and then work there post-graduation… it goes from being a family alma mater to being a crutch. The BUbble has been a safe haven for seven years, and it’s scary to consider leaving that security for wild adventures.

But once you’ve decided to move, the next question is _how far_ to move. Across the neighborhood? Across town? Maybe to a suburb for a different lifestyle? How about across a whole country? Madness!

Anyone who knows me—I’m so sorry for your loss—can attest that I hate change. It doesn’t excite me or thrill with the incessant hum of possibility. Some people love it; I don’t. I see only inconvenience… messing with what ain’t broke. Any break in my daily/monthly/annual routine must be forced. I don’t go quietly either.

Earlier this week, I accepted a job offer in Southern California and gave notice to my current gig at BU—my home for seven years. Including childhood, I have spent two-thirds of my life in Massachusetts. And now I follow generations of East Coasters to the West.

Why now? Well, this bourgeois designer is single, has no kids, doesn’t own a car, doesn’t own a house, isn’t in grad school—which is all very sad. That said, I realized that if I want to have a random, reckless adventure to break the rut of my increasingly predictable life, isn’t now the time to do it? You agree, right? I knew you would. We’re obviously off to a great start.

When I get there (sometime in mid-August), I’ll working as a web designer at **Blizzard Entertainment**. Who knows what that will bring, but you and my seven or eight other readers get to come along with me.

Check back for the hilarious tales of a grumpy, uptight New England-transplant, trying to make it work in sunny, perky Orange County, California. Also, there’ll be Instagram photos. Californians get all hot-and-bothered for selfies.

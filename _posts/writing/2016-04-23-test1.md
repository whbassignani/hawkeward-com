## Past? What past?

While working on this site, I stumbled across [Paul Stamatiou’s personal site](http://paulstamatiou.com/) and a recent post about [having blogged for 10 years](http://paulstamatiou.com/10-years-blogging/).

It’s incredibly humbling to look through his archive and find almost half a lifetime of work. And when I compare it to the same ten years of my life, what do I have to show for it? Some learnings, some posts, but mostly social media nonsense and wasted time.

<p class="lede">This is a new site.</p>

I thought about ending the post right there, but I’m trying this new make-good-content-on-a-regular-basis habit. It’s difficult.

To break down my changes, let’s start with the three goals:

1. Focus on writing
2. Start with a foundation
3. Try new technology and techniques

After [moving to California](/writing/into-the-west/) for a new job, I stopped updating my site. The old design’s purpose had been achieved; a steady job meant no more freelancing and no more job applications. Today, this site probably gets a few dozen hits a month. I assume that most of these visitors are lost (or search engine bots).

My new goal is to [write every week](/writing/NEEDSLUGHERE). This changes everything. Whereas a standard portfolio site gets semi-annual updates, a blog has to house a regular flow of content. It also has to be easy to maintain. Plus, I don’t know what my content is going to look like a week, month, year from now!

I decided to start with a plain design that I can build on, as well as a [living style guide](/style-guide) of interchangeable components.

This site was designed 100% “in-browser.” I wanted to experiment with stuff from my pseudo-bucket list: modular typographic scales, designing in browser, flexbox-only layouts, etc. Everything here is foundational—even the design—and stripped-down by design. My hope is that the site will evolve as my writing does.

## The details

### Type
I am using [Concourse](http://concoursefont.com) and [Equity](http://practicaltypography.com/equity.html) by Matthew Butterick. Both are highly legible, versatile, and nuanced typefaces, and they work well together. Go buy them!

The type sizes, line-height, gutters, and even some UI elements are set by a modular typographic scale. In the coming weeks, I’ll write more about my setup, but you can get a preview by looking at the Sass files on my [Github repo](https://github.com/whbassignani/hawkeward-com) for Hawkeward.com.

It’s all about the ~~Benjamins~~ Sass variables.

### Technology

Another goal was to replace old, hack-esque layout CSS with flexbox. Flex is not the answer to every problem—and it can make some patterns *harder*—but it’s the future and worth learning.

Never again will I massage padding or abuse floats to get a two-column layout to work.

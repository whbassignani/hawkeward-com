<p class="lede">Today, Holocaust survivor, author, and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Elie Wiesel, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/world/europe/elie-wiesel-auschwitz-survivor-and-nobel-peace-prize-winner-dies-at-87.html">passed away at the age of 87</a>.</p>

To most Americans who went through the public school system, his name is synonymous with [*Night*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book)), Wiesel’s iconic 1960 account of his struggles at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. That, however, is not what I remember him from.

I first saw him speak in 2007 when I was a freshman at Boston University, where he was a Professor Emeritus at the time. That Tuesday morning, he lectured on the book of Job. Not knowing what a privilege it actually was, I didn’t keep any notes from that morning.

Thankfully, he extended that talk into a trilogy of lectures in October 2009. The Quad, an independent online magazine at BU, [reports](http://buquad.com/2009/10/27/elie-wiesel-revists-an-old-favorite-the-story-of-job/):

<blockquote>
  <p>Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust and a renowned author, has lectured on the story of Job before but he said he returns to it because it is timeless and timely and “like a fairytale for adults.”</p>

  <p>He said that Job’s story is far-reaching because it could have taken place anywhere and everywhere…</p>

  <p>Among these dilemmas, are the struggles of indifference and silence, he said. “Silence helps the victimizer, never the victim,” Wiesel said. He also said that anything is preferable to indifference.[^1]</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Despite Job’s wretched tribulations, this adult fairy tale has a happy ending, Wiesel said. Just as starting over is an “essential component in Jewish history”, it is also how the story of Job ends, he said.</p>

  <p>“It is a story not of beginnings, but of beginning again,” said Wiesel.</p>
</blockquote>

Rest in peace.

[^1]: “We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.”

[FitRec](http://www.bu.edu/fitrec/) is BUâ€™s fitness center. <a href="http://www.bu.edu/interactive-design/">BU Interactive Design</a> redesigned their website and customized the WordPress-powered back-end to be highly editor-friendly. FitRec was built using Sass and mobile-first web development.

I also contributed some design to the responsive layouts whilst building the site, adjusting any desktop-only mockups to fit multiple viewports.
